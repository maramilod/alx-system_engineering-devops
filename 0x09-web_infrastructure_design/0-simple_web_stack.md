A ---explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

1 - What is a server ?

- is a computer or system that provides data services or programs to other computers over a network. Servers can be physical machines or virtual machines They store send receive and process data

2 - What is the role of the domain name ?

-  As a unique website identifier it is a human_readable address that allows users to access specific websites

3 - What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com ?

- is typically represented by a CNAME record in the DNS  A CNAME record maps an alias name to the true or canonical name in the case of www.foobar.com the CNAME record would map "www" to "foobar.com" this means that when someone tries to access www.foobar.com, the DNS system will automatically direct them to foobar.com.

4 - What is the role of the web server ?

-  is a server that stores, processes and delivers web pages to users Its main role is to respond to requests from clients over the internet Web servers handle HTTP requests from clients These requests can be for static content like html css JS files or dynamic content generated by server-side scripts.

5 - What is the role of the application server ?

- is to provide a runtime environment for hosting and executing applications or software components. It acts as an intermediary between the client devices and the backend systems or databases, facilitating the processing of application logic and data management

6 - What is the role of the database ?

- is to store, retrieve, and manage data It acts as a central repository where data is stored and accessed by deferent applications 

7 - What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website ?

- Communication between the client and the server occurs via the Internet and many protocols


B ---what the issues are with this infrastructure:

1 - SPOF ?

- if Mysql database is down all the site would be down.

2 - Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted) ?

- When we want to do some maintenance on any component, the server must be turned off because there is only one server, the web will be stopped for a while.

3 - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic ?

- It will be hard to expand because one server contains the required components 
 The server can quickly run out of resources or slow down when it starts receiving a lot of requests
