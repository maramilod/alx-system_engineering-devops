we have 3 servers.
We distributed the application server webserver
and database with in their own server
Now they became a cluster server
which is what happens when a group of servers works as a unit. 
We will also add anotherloadbalancer to distribute work load 
among them. 
And this load balancer will work with the other load balancer
to ditribute the work load among the servers.
